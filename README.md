Mecodify is an open-source tool created as part of the Media Conflict and Democratization Project (http://mecodem.eu) to help gather, analyse and visualise Twitter data for use by social science scholars. The name describes what it does, i.e., Message Codification by converting messages to systematic structures, tables, graphs and quantifiable content.

The platform remains in constant development and the first version (1.0) has been used for the research purposes indicated in the website above. This new version is adapted to use Twitter's new V2 API.

The software mainly uses PHP and Javascript and has used several open-source libraries including but not limited to HighCharts, D3Js for various components of the platform.
